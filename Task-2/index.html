        <h3>Why we should be thankful to doctors</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>They are the ones who work tirelessly to save lives, treat illnesses and help people lead healthier lives. </li> 
          <li>Doctors work long hours to ensure that their patients receive the best possible care. </li>
          <li>They undergo years of training and education to acquire the necessary knowledge and skills to treat and diagnose a wide range of illnesses and diseases. </li>
          <li>They have to make critical decisions on a daily basis, often under extreme pressure and with limited resources. </li>
          <li>
            They show compassion and care towards their patients, often going above and beyond their duty to ensure their patients' well-being.
          </li>
          <li>
            They are on the frontlines of public health crises, such as pandemics, and put themselves at risk to save lives.
          </li>
          <li>They not only treat physical illnesses, but also mental health disorders and provide support to patients and their families during difficult times. </li>
        </ul>
